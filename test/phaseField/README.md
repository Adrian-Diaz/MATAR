## Phase Field Simulation of Phase Seperation
This folder uses the MATAR library to handle the array data structures need for the implementation of phase field method for phase seperation in binary alloy. 
The implementation allows for both 2D and 3D simulations.
The Cahn-Hilliard equation in phase field modeling is solved using the semi-implicit fourier spectral algorithm [[1]](#1).
